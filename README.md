# WaspCoin
An attempt to understand blockchain and how cryptocurrencies work through creating my own cryptocurrency
Introducing WaspCoin

I used C++ and https://davenash.com/2017/10/build-a-blockchain-with-c/ this tutorial to try and understand how the basis of cryptocurrencies work.
Tis is a simple PoW and aims to explain the foundations of cryptocurrency

Although this cannot really be used in real life as it does not has the cryptographic public private keys so anyone can create any transaction in the blockchain currently.(future update: add transaction safety measures)
